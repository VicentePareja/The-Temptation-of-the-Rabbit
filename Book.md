## Chapter 1
## The war of the Chiefs.

What is a Ceo's duty? That is a pretty key question when talking about a start-up. To understand it, we need to talk first about what is a start-up and the role of the Ceo's biggest enemy: His CTO.

A start-up is like a bycicle but going down a Mount, the faster the bycicle go, its less likely you are going to fall. At the same time if you crush it will be "worse". The truth of the matter is, if you go slow you are garantee to fall, not even the expert cycler is able to handle a bike going slow. On the other end, going fast is scary and is also quite likely to crush. You will have a chance though. NEVER drive slowly your bike. It's garantee failure.

Usually, this "bike" its not driven by only one pilot. On the contrary, its by two: The archetipical CEO and its corresponding CTO. We will analyse this case first, as is the most common in the 21st century, although there are more options [Check founders chapter, (to be written and linked)].

So, how can a Bike on a hill be driven by two guys? Should they aim for the same like lovers that always agree? Or, on the contrary, are the enemys at war? 

In the methaphore, the CEO should be something like the strong muscle legs of our cyclist. He is ambicious and strong, so naturally he will pedal as fast as posible. 

The CTO, on the countrary, is the eyes of the cyclist and sees a lot of spike bushes, trees and even rocks on his way. So, naturally he will be scared of the way down the hill (as he should) and will yell everytime he stuff like "Be careful!", "Slow down!", "I cant evade that tree fast enough" and "If we sont slow down we will crush with that rock inevitably".

So, as you can see, the should fight a lot. They must. If the ambicious muscles cycle too fast the fear of the CTO will indeed come to life so fats he is unable to react and both die. There is a catch though, they may not know it (although they should) but they are not the only cyclist in that hill. There are many of them. And usually only the first to arrive at the fertile valley made of candy, sugar and flowers is the one that gets ALL the candy. Or, do you remember the second fully-working social network? Or the second search engine to not just filter by keywords? Me neither.

In my opinion, in the War of the chiefs the CEO MUST win. but only slightly. If you are a CTO, try to find a Bull as a CEO. He may be almost uncontrollable. But remember the almost part, because you are the only brakes in the car. On the contrary if your are searching for your CTO you must be able to win 80% of the times. But if he is unable to tame the rabious irrational dog you are once in a while, you are likely to bite bigger bones you can handle right now.

The perfect team works like a beautiful rally car on full speed to win the race. The CTO yells "hard left on 200m!" and the CEO, without releasing the accelerator in the slightlest, trust its chief and makes the full turn in the 200° turn like its life depends on it. And only if 100% necesary, the CTO should say the prohibed words "Brake! U turn to the right in 120!" And his CEO, with anger, should actually listen. [link to a race of rally, linked].

PD: Obviously, this two figures should be in the abstract, not in the concrete. If you are a solo founder, think of it as two forces inside you. The same for teams of three.You could even be the CTO and work at heart as the accelerar. Etc. 

## Chapter 2
## CEO double click. Agility?

So, as its clear onC Chapter one [link to it] a CEO should try to move fast. But, what does that even mean?

I could send an empty email in like 2 seconds. Is that good? is it bad? I dont know. Is not clear. First, we need to define a previous concept: Vision.

A good founder needs to try to get the team or institution somewhere. Anywhere. But never everywhere. Bad example: "we want to be the best e-commerce in the world with a uber-like app inside and a search engine with AI inside that..." yeah, sure honey. Better example: "We will create wheels for trucks with this material recently discovered. We will start with coast to coast large truck companies in USA as they really would benefit with our product".

To be fair, founder tend to be super ambicious, creative ans thrive in caotic industries. For that reason, sometimes their "Vision" has to be vague or abstract. Which is not a bad thing. The bad thing is that your milestones or objectives ar also vague, bad define or too abstract.

Once our good founder has a clear, not vague, milestone in some time frame. He needs to align the team towards that goal. aligning teams is actually a super hard thing to do. Because everyone has diferent opinions, distractions and subsets of information/beliefs. If you go fast, without aligment, its like a boat where everyone row randomly. What you want is something closer to a trirreme perfectly sinc at the same time, where you a nice compas and map, the team beliefs in you and you have a huge drum sounding "BUM, BUM, BUM" every 1,5 seconds and EVERYONE rows at the same time at the same direction.

What you want to maximize is: the speed of the rowers and the aligment between them. In a formula could be something close to Speed * Aligment. Its almost as vectors moving your boat. If every vector is pointing randomly you will barely move. On the same way, if every vector is align but they are very small you will go sloowly to your goal. In mathy way of puting it: you want to maximize the sum of the dot products of the vectors with respect to the direction your vision.

This new quantity, we will call it from now on: Agility. (If someone has a better name I am open to it)
