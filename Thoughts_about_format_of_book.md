# Understability

The main goal is to share knoweldge. So, the way its written should avoid unnecesary complecity if needed.


# Everything should be linked

There is not a reason to not do it. Its simply better. Like, if you are mentioning a youtuber, just put the channel bro. This wont be printed (at leastttt til a year). So, lets make good use of tech please.


## Dumps

I will put some random dumps to not lose the ideas. But they will intentionally not be ordered. They shouldn't be. The we'll organize it along the way in proper docs.


## Lenguage

I think I am choosing english. Even though i love spanish (and its an objectibly superior lenguage IMP), people that care enough about this content in the hispanic world will likely know english well. The opposite is not true. Also, We may leave out some valuable europeans or asians in the team too. So english it is. I also take the opportunity if needed to apologize for my english. As is not my first lenguage and this is the first time ever i write something longer than an email in english.
